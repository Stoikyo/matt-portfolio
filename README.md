# Designer Portfolio

Static portfolio site for Matt Grant. Pure HTML/CSS with light JS, no build step required.

## Structure
- `index.html` – main landing page.
- `projects/` – individual project case studies.
- `assets/img/` – site imagery (headshots, logos, snapshots).
- `assets/favicons/` – favicon and mark assets.
- `docs/` – supporting notes (`AGENT_NOTES.md`, `front_end_design.md`).

## Status
- Rebuild in progress; this change primes a PR for the next iteration.

## View locally
- Clone and open `index.html` in your browser; no build or install needed.
