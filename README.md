# Designer Portfolio

This repository contains a single-page portfolio for a Designer application, built as a standalone HTML document.

## Scope
- Single `index.html` file.
- Pure HTML + CSS, minimal JS.
- No frameworks, no external fonts, no build tools.

## How to run
- Open `index.html` in a browser locally.
- Or view it via GitHub Pages once enabled.

## Conventions
- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Prefer incremental changes instead of big rewrites.
