# AI Agent Standing Notes

- This repo MUST stay as:
  - One HTML entry point: `index.html`.
  - All CSS inside a single `<style>` tag in that file.
  - Any JS in a single `<script>` at the bottom of that file.
- Do NOT:
  - Add React, Vue, Svelte, or any JS framework.
  - Add bundlers, build steps, or external dependencies.
- Always:
  - Use semantic HTML5 and keep the page accessible.
  - Preserve the core sections: hero, about, projects, contact, footer (once they exist) unless explicitly told otherwise.
  - Treat `TODO` comments in `index.html` as safe places to change content.
  - Prefer small, focused changes and keep the HTML valid.
